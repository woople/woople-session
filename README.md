# Woople Session

An easy way to login as a woople administrator.

## Purpose & Rationale

* Woople has a lot of different applications.
* We don't want to maintain a seperate list of logins for each one.
* We want to login to all the applications from a central location.
* 'Child' Applications of woople can use this gem to make logins easy
